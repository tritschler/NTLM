# NTLM
A Java implementation of Microsoft NTLM https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows-server/security/kerberos/ntlm-overview
Since NTLM is not publicly documented
mainly used to authenticate users to proxies, establish local DB connection and exporting data via a SSL tunnel
Was developped inside a java Applet, refactoring needed to include in modern java apps
